# Simulation Optimization

## Description
This repository is primarily for Simulation Optimization seminar at the University of Munster. It includes extension of Knowledge Gradient policy for Sequential A/B Testing problem.

## Structure
  1. data/ - folder with the generated data from experiments
  2. SetUp.R - script with functions to setup an experiment
  3. Utils.R - script with miscellaneous functions
  4. KGPolicy.R - script with extension of KG policy for Sequential A/B Testing problem
  5. RandomPolicy.R - script with random policy
  6. Experiments.R - script with experiments 

## Experiments
All experiments can be reproduced sourcing Experiments.R script. It will take up to 2 days, so data can be simply loaded from data/ folder to save time.
